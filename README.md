NexoraHub is a desktop launcher for managing local Minecraft modpack profiles.

PRIVACITY:

Data is stored locally: tokens in OS credential vault (keytar) or encrypted file; cache with only UUID/name in %AppData%.nexorahub\cache\user.json. No telemetry, no server side. Supported account types: Personal Microsoft accounts only. Platform: Mobile and desktop applications (public client). The app calls Minecraft Services endpoints: launcher/login, authentication/login_with_xbox, entitlements/mcstore, minecraft/profile, strictly to verify ownership and display profile.

WE NOT SAVE YOUR CREDENTIALLS.
